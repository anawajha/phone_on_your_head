# phone_on_your_head
It is a game based on a group of people
Someone puts the phone on their head and the game displays the word
The player must try to guess this word with the help and hints of his friends
If he answers correctly, he tilts the phone forward, gets a point and moves to the next word
If he answers incorrectly, the phone tilts back and a sound is output and no points are counted for him, and moves to the next word with a one minute timer for each round and when the time is about to end, a warning sound (clockwise sound)
At the end of the words, the player's score is displayed


Control the game through phone sensors(Accelerometer & Gyroscope sensors)
